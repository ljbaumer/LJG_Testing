AI
- Still from the movie the apartment with Jack Lemon... show's the worker's floor of the NY life insurance company in 1959... the called people who did actuarial work computers... 
- Now: A room of computers is this gleaming data center...

Which has recapitulated the human brain: 
- Human brain - shows neural network (recpitulation of the human brain)

Before: A picture from the 1960s of a general motor production line... lots of humans watching a car go through 
- Industrial robotics AI video
- Waymo video driving in San Francisco (Eliza to find a good waymo driving video)

Then: Smoking belching coal fire plant
Now: We're now doing it in these massive solar arrays... the advent of batteries that can capture this... and perhaps most promisingly fusion (new video for lucas) 
- Fusion video

Quantum: Start with the funny picture of Einstein... reasoned about a quantum world, but set the stage for an understanding of quantum mechanics
Today: expressed in this amazing form of computation that promises almost infinite parallelism 

Then: NY stock exchange in 1929 with the overwhelm of paper... they did everything on paper
Today: We have the promise of a shared ledger that allows for frictionless exchange of money and mobility of collateral around the world 

Then: In 1969 we had the Apollo launch 
Today: we are grabbing these things with tweezers... (Eliza to find tweezer grab video) 

Then: Picture of the compaq mobile briefcase
Now: World of full ambience

What's driving this, this fundamental multi period multi regime of Moore's law... 
- Moore's law slide

...Break... awesome library (the JPM "The Morgan" private library)

3x books (start with the book, then the images)

Slide or video to punctuate each of those three periods... 

Some video or visual to represent geopolitical tumult / change  (see if Eliza can find any GIF or video of empires over time or changing borders over time)
- see if there is a map dissolve of Europe in 1490... borders shifting and moving around... 
- (The common denominator from these extreme rates of change is geopolitical change and high rates of tumult)

Industrial robotics 

Waymo video driving in San Francisco 

Pan over a massive sweeping field of solar panels (fundamental wellspring for all this production of intelligence)

Fusion (the promise of zero carbon dense power at vanishingly low cost that accelerates everything we've seen)

[Start with still image beforehand] Quantum (speaking of acceleration, imagine a world of quantum computation at scale)

[Start with an image of a ledger... the concept of a new kind of ledger]

Blockchain (that ledger fascilitates the seamless movement of money around the world)

And we will go beyond earthbound transactions to exploring space (recapture, or starlink video in space)

Ambience (and finally all of this technology will go from something we observe as a glass rectangle on our hands)
