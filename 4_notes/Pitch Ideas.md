1) The “making of” the first “AIPO” … in place of the traditional, canned IPO pitch video we do a recording of the team using all AI tools to produce each component part of the pitch
	- (Some of those components will be what is described below)
	- Modeling agent and outputs 
	- Slide builder for some
	- Video recordings of people dictating live into these tools to generate prompts 
	- Recordings of spawning a fleet of agents to prosecute each potential ask 
	- Filming of making the storyboard for the storyboard can be the final clip 
	- This week we should make a storyboard outline 
	- Some funny stuff like using ACP to get red bull for the analyst 


2) Taking AI S-1 drafting to its logical conclusion 
	- Take 100 of the last tech IPO business section 
	- Comparative analysis of old, canonical business sections 
		- E.g., IBM S-1 (may be too early for biz section)
		- Apple S-1
		- Intel S-1
		- TI S-1
		- DuPont S-1
		- Polaroid S-1
		- McDonald's S-1
		- FedEx 
		- Microsoft 
	- Precursor to S-1s
		- Standard oil 1910
		- American Express 1924
		- U.S. Steel 1901
		- Ford IPO (Goldman did this)


3) Level up of our T-IPO format... can we use something like Konstantin's simulation engine to simulate all the buyers in a prospective process? 
	- E.g., once we get 50K shares @ $100 from a bunch of buyers, can we model out exactly who we think will go up or down in price based on qualitative and quantitative indications? 



4) Testing the waters / roadshow simulator... same idea but ingest all of our notes on each of the potential buyers... ingest all the old pricing data from prior IPOs... see if we can build a simulator that will predict what each investor will ask / double down on in the questions... see if we can "build" the buyer book before the buyers even put in any orders 
	1) One version is Konstantin's agentic simulation (that is usable as a report)
	2) One version is just dump in notes and chat with the notes (that is usable live)



5) Much more tactically... can we get a big SWF or some other institutional buyer to come in for a mega big anchor order? Can we tie that to compute? E.g., with Q 



6) Build out
